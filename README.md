Code for Calculating Differences in Sorted List
Description:
This program takes a space-separated list of integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then calculates the differences between the largest element and the first three elements of the sorted list.

Features:
Takes a space-separated input of integers.

Sorts the list of integers.

Outputs the differences between the largest element (after sorting) and the first three smallest elements.

How to Use:
Run the script.

Input a space-separated list of integers when prompted.

The program will output three values, which represent:

The difference between the largest and smallest element.

The difference between the largest and second smallest element.

The difference between the largest and third smallest element.

Example:
Input:
Copy
Edit
5 2 8 3 1 7 4
Output:
Copy
Edit
7 5 4
Explanation:
The sorted list is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]

The differences are:

8 - 1 = 7

8 - 2 = 5

8 - 3 = 4

Requirements:
Python 3.x
